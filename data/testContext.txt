The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located in Paris, France.
It was designed by the French engineer Gustave Eiffel and was completed in 1889 as the entrance arch to the 1889 Worldâ€™s Fair.
Standing 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.
The Eiffel Tower is one of the most-visited paid monuments in the world, attracting millions of visitors every year.
It has three levels accessible to the public, with restaurants on the first two levels and an observation deck on the third level.
